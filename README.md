# NEO 3.0 Specification

Community Specification Paper: A Technical Description for Neo Blockchain

## document format
The Community Specification Paper base document started as pure LaTeX (as a [Yellow Paper](https://github.com/NeoResearch/yellowpaper])), as usual in academic publications, however the syntax is not considered as friendly as Markdown. So, why not merge both? :)
In order to facilitate the contributions to the document, we decided to adopt pandoc format, which allows hybrid LaTeX + Markdown syntax.

### base structure
The structure of the document consists of five files:
- specification_paper.md : main document in Mardown + LaTeX (this file is automatically generated by `merge_sections.sh`)
- [metadata.yaml](doc-base/metadata.yaml) : document metadata (authors, abstract, ...)
- [style_specification_paper.pandoc](doc-base/style_specification_paper.pandoc) : document style (LaTeX headings)
- [eisvogel.latex](doc-base/eisvogel.latex) : base LaTeX template (Eisvogel template with small changes)
- [references.bib](doc-base/references.bib) : bibliography in BibTeX format

Specification Paper sections are separated on `sections/` folder (these are used as source to generate `specification_paper.md` file).

Current draft proposal includes 11 sections + references (this may be changed by community, as anything else!):
- [01_Introduction.md](sections/01_Introduction.md) : expected release date -> Q2 2019
- [02_Network.md](sections/02_Network.md) : expected release date -> Q2+ 2019
- [03_Numbers.md](sections/03_Numbers.md) : expected release date -> Q2 2019
- [04_Cryptography.md](sections/04_Cryptography.md) : expected release date -> Q2 2019
- [05_Assets.md](sections/05_Assets.md) : expected release date -> Q2+ 2019
- [06_Transactions.md](sections/06_Transactions.md) : expected release date -> Q2+ 2019
- [07_NeoVM_NeoContract.md](sections/07_NeoVM_NeoContract.md) : expected release date -> Q2 2019
- [08_dBFT.md](sections/08_dBFT.md) : first released 14 March, 2019. **PDF:** [Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance: Technical details, challenges and perspectives](releases/08_dBFT.pdf)
- [09_SmartEconomy.md](sections/09_SmartEconomy.md) : expected release date -> Q2+ 2019
- References (automatically generated from [references.bib](doc-base/references.bib)): expected release date -> Q2+ 2019


## build instructions (manual build)
Install pandoc and LaTeX base (try [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/try)). On debian-based linux, you can simply run `make install`, and all dependencies will be installed.

After pandoc and LaTeX base are available, you can simply run `make`, which will generate the specification paper pdf.

### building specific section
Any section can be build using command `make section` and passing `SECTION` parameter.
For example: `make section SECTION=08_dBFT` will build section 08 (it will be stored on `build/08_dBFT.pdf`).

## automatically building using docker
The easiest way to build is by using docker.

* Build the docker image using `docker_build.sh`

* Compile the specification paper using `docker_run.sh`

* Output will be generated as `build/neo_3.0_specification_paper.pdf`

## How to contribute
If you know Neo technology and want to contribute, feel free to directly submit a Pull Request with the desired changes.
Initially, the idea is to create a broad and complete initial version of the document, which will be polished in the future.
