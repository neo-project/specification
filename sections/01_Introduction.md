# Introduction

The Specification Paper is a community-driven initiative to provide a technical specification for Neo blockchain.
This technical material is currently focused on NEO 3.0 documentation.
It is organized in sections, describing diverse details of the protocol, from consensus mechanisms, cryptography and smart contracts.
Every part of the protocol may be covered here, although it is recommended to keep the scope as limited as possible to  fundamental pieces of the technology.
These topics are suggested by Neo community and may be changed in the future, so feel free to contribute.
