# Transactions

## How it works

## Signer and co-signers

## Attaching network and system fees

The fields of the transaction in which this values are attached are:

* system fee is attached as GAS (To be updated)
* network fee is attached as Sender (To be updated)

As soon as transaction enters in the mempool, these values are updated in the pre-balance.
